ux_design_principles:
   - "User goals and tasks - Understanding what users need to accomplish and designing to make those primary tasks seamless and efficient"
   - "Information architecture - Organizing content and features in a logical hierarchy that matches users' mental models"
   - "Progressive disclosure - Revealing complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users while still providing access to advanced features"
   - "Visual hierarchy - Using size, color, contrast, and positioning to guide attention to the most important elements first"
   - "Affordances and signifiers - Making interactive elements clearly identifiable through visual cues that indicate how they work"
   - "Consistency - Maintaining uniform patterns, components, and interactions across screens to reduce cognitive load"
   - "Accessibility - Ensuring the design works for users of all abilities (color contrast, screen readers, keyboard navigation)"
   - "Error prevention - Designing to help users avoid mistakes before they happen rather than just handling errors after they occur"
   - "Feedback - Providing clear signals when actions succeed or fail, and communicating system status at all times"
   - "Performance considerations - Accounting for loading times and designing appropriate loading states"
   - "Responsive design - Ensuring the interface works well across various screen sizes and orientations"
   - "Platform conventions - Following established patterns from iOS/Android/Web to meet user expectations"
   - "Microcopy and content strategy - Crafting clear, concise text that guides users through the experience"
   - "Aesthetic appeal - Creating visually pleasing designs that align with brand identity while prioritizing usability"
