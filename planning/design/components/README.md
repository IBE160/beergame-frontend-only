# Component Library Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the component library used in the Beer Game application. Our component library is a collection of reusable UI elements that ensure consistency and efficiency in our design and development process.

## Principles
- **Reusable**: Components are designed to be reusable across different features.
- **Consistent**: Components adhere to the design system's styles and principles.
- **Accessible**: All components are built with accessibility in mind.
- **Composable**: Components can be combined to create more complex UI patterns.
