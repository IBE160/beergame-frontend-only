# iOS Adaptations

## Overview
This document outlines the design adaptations for the iOS platform.

## Guidelines
- **Navigation**: Use a bottom tab bar for primary navigation if the app were to become more complex. For now, the web-based navigation is sufficient.
- **Typography**: Use the San Francisco (SF) font if possible, but Inter is a good fallback.
- **Gestures**: Support standard iOS gestures, such as swiping back to navigate.
- **Safe Areas**: Ensure that all content is within the safe areas of the screen, avoiding notches and the home indicator.
