# Android Adaptations

## Overview
This document outlines the design adaptations for the Android platform.

## Guidelines
- **Navigation**: Use a navigation drawer for top-level navigation if the app were to become more complex.
- **Typography**: Use the Roboto font if possible, but Inter is a good fallback.
- **System Back Button**: Ensure that the system back button behaves as expected, navigating to the previous screen.
- **Material Design**: While we have our own design system, we should still be mindful of Material Design principles to ensure a familiar experience for Android users.
