# User Journey: Landing Page

### Core Experience Flow

**Step 1: Entry Point (First Impression)**
- **Trigger**: User navigates to the application URL.
- **State Description**: The hero section is displayed with a compelling headline, a brief sub-headline explaining the game, and a prominent "Play Now" button. The visual design is clean, using the primary color palette and high-quality background imagery or subtle animations.
- **Available Actions**: 
    - Primary: Click "Play Now".
    - Secondary: Scroll down to learn more.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: The "Play Now" button is the focal point, using the accent color to draw attention.
- **System Feedback**: The page loads quickly (<2s) with a subtle fade-in animation on the headline.

**Step 2: Information Discovery (Scrolling)**
- **Task Flow**: User scrolls down past the hero section.
- **State Changes**: The page smoothly scrolls to the "What is it?" and "How to Play" sections. Each section is clearly delineated with headings and uses a combination of text and simple diagrams.
- **Error Prevention**: N/A for this step.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: The user is presented with more detailed information as they scroll, but it's broken into digestible chunks.
- **Microcopy**: Headings are direct questions (e.g., "What is the Beer Game?") to engage the user.

**Step 3: Decision & Action (Starting the Game)**
- **Success State**: The user feels informed and confident enough to play. They click either the top or bottom "Play Now" button.
- **Error Recovery**: N/A.
- **Exit Options**: The user can leave the page at any time. The primary goal is to convert them to a player in this session.

### Advanced Users & Edge Cases

- **Returning User**: If a user has a game in progress (detected via local storage), the hero button might change to "Resume Game" with a secondary option to "Start New Game".
- **Empty States**: N/A for the landing page.
- **Error States**: N/A unless there's a critical loading failure, in which case a simple error message would appear.
- **Loading States**: A lightweight skeleton loader or spinner is visible for a fraction of a second if the network is slow.
- **Offline/Connectivity**: The page should be viewable offline if cached by a service worker, but the "Play Now" button would be disabled if the core game assets aren't available.
