# Feature: Landing Page & Game Introduction (F001)

## 1. User Experience Analysis

- **Primary User Goal**: To quickly understand what the Beer Game is, why it's valuable, and how to start playing.
- **Success Criteria**: A new user can explain the game's purpose and starts the game configuration within 2 minutes of landing on the page.
- **Key Pain Points Addressed**: Eliminates the confusion and high barrier to entry often associated with academic simulations.
- **User Personas**: Primarily targets students and professionals new to supply chain concepts.

## 2. Information Architecture

- **Content Hierarchy**:
    1.  **Hero Section**: Elevator pitch and a single, clear call-to-action ("Play Now").
    2.  **What is it?**: A concise explanation of the game's purpose and learning objectives.
    3.  **How to Play**: Simple, step-by-step instructions with visuals.
    4.  **Why it Matters**: A brief section on the "bullwhip effect" to establish educational value.
    5.  **Final CTA**: A concluding call-to-action to encourage users to start.
- **Navigation Structure**: A single-page layout with clear headings. The primary navigation will be the scroll-based discovery of these sections.
- **Mental Model Alignment**: The page is structured like a quickstart guide, aligning with the user's expectation of learning a new game.
- **Progressive Disclosure Strategy**: Core information is presented upfront in the hero section. More detailed rules and concepts are placed further down the page for users who want to learn more before playing.
