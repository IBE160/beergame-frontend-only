# Implementation Notes: Real-Time Game Dashboard

## Overview
This document provides guidance for developers on implementing the real-time game dashboard.

## Component Library
- **Metric Display**: Create a `Metric` component to display key numbers with labels. This component should support different visual styles for emphasis (e.g., a "danger" style for backorders).
- **Charts**: Use a library like `Recharts` or `Chart.js` to create the historical data charts. Ensure the library is responsive and accessible.
- **Input**: Use a styled `Input` component for the order placement field.

## State Management
- A robust state management solution (e.g., Zustand or Redux Toolkit) is recommended for the dashboard, as it will need to handle complex game state logic.
- The game state should be updated in a predictable manner, likely using a reducer function that processes actions like "PLACE_ORDER".

## Animations
- Use a library like `Framer Motion` to handle the week advancement animations. This will help to create a smooth and visually appealing sequence.
- Ensure that all animations are tied to the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.

## Accessibility
- Implement the ARIA live regions using a dedicated component or hook to manage announcements.
- For the charts, ensure that the chosen library has good accessibility support. If not, provide a fallback data table.

## Performance
- The dashboard should be performant and responsive. Avoid unnecessary re-renders by using memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) where appropriate.
- The game logic should be efficient to avoid any lag during the week advancement sequence.
