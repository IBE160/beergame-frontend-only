# User Journey: Real-Time Game Dashboard

## Overview
This document maps out the typical weekly user journey on the game dashboard.

## User Persona
- **Name**: Alex
- **Role**: Player (Retailer)
- **Goal**: To manage inventory effectively and minimize costs.

## User Journey Map (Weekly Loop)

| Step | User Action | User Thoughts | Touchpoint | Opportunities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. **Assess** | Reviews the current game state: inventory, incoming orders, backorders, and costs. | "My inventory is low, and a big order just came in. I need to order more." | Dashboard Metrics | Make the key metrics highly visible and easy to understand. |
| 2. **Analyze** | Checks the historical data charts to see trends in orders and inventory. | "Demand has been steady for a few weeks. I should order enough to cover it." | Historical Data Charts | Ensure charts are clear and provide useful insights. |
| 3. **Decide** | Enters an order quantity in the input field. | "I'll order 12 units to be safe." | Order Input Field | Provide clear validation and feedback. |
| 4. **Act** | Clicks the "Place Order" button. | "Let's see what happens next week." | CTA Button | Give immediate feedback that the order has been placed and the game is advancing. |
| 5. **Observe** | Watches the animations as the new week begins and the dashboard updates. | "Okay, new inventory has arrived. Let's do this again." | Dashboard Animations | Use animations to clearly show the flow of goods and information. |

## Pain Points & Solutions
- **Information Overload**: The dashboard could present too much data at once.
  - **Solution**: Use a clear visual hierarchy and progressive disclosure to prioritize information.
- **Uncertainty**: Players might not know how much to order.
  - **Solution**: Provide historical data and contextual tips to help guide their decisions.
