# Feature: Real-Time Game Dashboard

## Overview
This document provides a design summary for the main game dashboard. This is the primary screen where players will spend most of their time, making decisions and observing the state of the supply chain.

## Key Design Goals
- **Information Clarity**: Present key game data (inventory, orders, costs) in a clear and easily scannable format.
- **Decision Support**: Help players make informed ordering decisions by providing relevant data and visualizations.
- **Engagement**: Create a visually engaging and responsive dashboard that keeps players immersed in the game.
