# User Journey: AI Partners

### Core Experience Flow

**Step 1: Unseen Action**
- **Trigger**: The player submits their weekly order.
- **Task Flow**: In the background, the AI for the other three roles runs its own logic to decide what to order.
- **System Feedback**: The player sees the results of the AI's decisions in the next week (e.g., the size of the order they receive).

**Step 2: Optional Insight**
- **Task Flow**: If the player is curious, they can enable an option to see why the AI made its choices.
- **System Feedback**: A small, non-intrusive overlay appears, showing the AI's thought process (e.g., "My inventory is low, and I received a large order, so I am ordering more than usual.").
