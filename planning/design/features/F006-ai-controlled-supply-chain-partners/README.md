# Feature: AI-Controlled Supply Chain Partners (F006)

## 1. User Experience Analysis

- **Primary User Goal**: To have a realistic and challenging single-player experience.
- **Success Criteria**: The AI partners behave in a way that is believable and creates the intended learning experience (i.e., the bullwhip effect).
- **Key Pain Points Addressed**: Removes the need to find multiple people to play the game.

## 2. Information Architecture

- This is a non-visual feature for the most part. The AI's decisions are made visible through the Supply Chain Flow Visualization and the Historical Data Charts.
- There may be an option to "Show AI Rationale" which would display a small text box explaining why the AI made a certain order.
