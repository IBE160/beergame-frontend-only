# Implementation Notes: Data Charts

- **Library**: Use a mature charting library like [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) or [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). Recharts is often preferred for its composable React components.
- **Data**: The chart components will take the `historicalData` array from the global state as a prop.
- **Performance**: For long games, consider down-sampling the data for the overview chart and only showing the full data on zoom. Memoize chart components heavily to prevent re-renders.
