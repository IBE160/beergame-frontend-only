# Screen States: Data Charts

## Component: Chart Panel

### State: Default

**Visual Design**: A set of line charts displaying the game data. The lines are colored according to the color system.

### State: Hover

**Visual Design**: A vertical line and a tooltip appear on the chart, highlighting the data point under the user's cursor.

### State: Empty

**Visual Design**: Before the game has progressed a few weeks, the charts will show an "empty" state, perhaps with a message like "Play a few weeks to see your data."
