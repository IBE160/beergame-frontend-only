# User Journey: Data Charts

### Core Experience Flow

**Step 1: Viewing the Charts**
- **Trigger**: The user navigates to the charts panel on the dashboard.
- **Task Flow**: The user can see line charts showing inventory, orders, and costs over the weeks of the game.

**Step 2: Gaining Insight**
- **Task Flow**: The user hovers over a data point on a chart.
- **System Feedback**: A tooltip appears, showing the exact value for that week. This allows for detailed analysis.
- **Insight**: The user might notice that the orders placed by the manufacturer are much more volatile than the actual customer demand, which is the core learning of the game.
