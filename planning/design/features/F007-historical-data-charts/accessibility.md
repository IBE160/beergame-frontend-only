# Accessibility: Data Charts

- **Data Table**: A tabular representation of the chart data must be provided as an alternative for screen reader users.
- **Keyboard Navigable**: A user should be able to navigate through the data points of the chart using the keyboard.
- **Color Contrast**: The lines in the chart must have sufficient contrast with the background and with each other.
- **Patterns**: Use patterns (like dashes or dots) in addition to color to differentiate between data series.
