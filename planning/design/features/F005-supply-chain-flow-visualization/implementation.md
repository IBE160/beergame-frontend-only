# Implementation Notes: Supply Chain Visualization

- **Technology**: SVG is the recommended technology for this component due to its scalability and ability to be manipulated with CSS and JavaScript.
- **Animation Library**: A library like Framer Motion or GSAP could be used to handle the animations of the icons along the SVG paths.
- **Component Structure**: The component will take the full `supplyChain` state as a prop and render the visualization based on that data.
