# Feature: Supply Chain Flow Visualization (F005)

## 1. User Experience Analysis

- **Primary User Goal**: To understand the structure of the supply chain and see how orders and products move between the different roles.
- **Success Criteria**: A user can trace the path of an order from the retailer to the manufacturer.
- **Key Pain Points Addressed**: Makes the abstract concept of a supply chain tangible and easy to understand.

## 2. Information Architecture

- **Content Hierarchy**:
    1.  **Roles**: The four roles are displayed horizontally.
    2.  **Connections**: Lines or arrows show the flow of orders (upstream) and products (downstream).
    3.  **In-Transit Items**: Icons or numbers represent the orders and shipments currently in the pipeline.
