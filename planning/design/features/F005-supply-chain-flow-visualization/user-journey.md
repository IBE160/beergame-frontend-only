# User Journey: Supply Chain Visualization

### Core Experience Flow

**Step 1: Viewing the Flow**
- **Trigger**: The user looks at the visualization panel on the dashboard.
- **Task Flow**: The user can see the four roles and the connections between them. Their own role is highlighted.
- **System Feedback**: Animated icons move along the paths to show the movement of orders and products each week.

**Step 2: Understanding Delays**
- **Task Flow**: The user can see that it takes time for their orders to reach their supplier and for shipments to arrive.
- **System Feedback**: The visualization is divided into stages to represent the weekly delays.
