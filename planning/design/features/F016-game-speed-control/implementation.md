# Implementation Notes: Game Speed

- **State**: The game speed will be a global state variable.
- **CSS Variables**: The easiest way to implement this is to have the animation durations based on a CSS variable (e.g., `--animation-speed`). Changing the game speed simply updates the value of this CSS variable.
    ```css
    :root {
      --animation-speed: 1; /* Default speed */
    }

    .animated {
      transition: all calc(300ms / var(--animation-speed)) ease-out;
    }
    ```
