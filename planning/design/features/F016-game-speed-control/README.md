# Feature: Game Speed Control (F016)

## 1. User Experience Analysis

- **Primary User Goal**: To play the game at a faster or slower pace.
- **Success Criteria**: A user can adjust the game speed and see a noticeable difference in the week transition animations.
- **Key Pain Points Addressed**: Allows experienced players to speed up the game, and new players to slow it down to better understand what is happening.

## 2. Information Architecture

- This will be a setting, likely accessible from a settings menu on the main dashboard.
- It will be a slider or a set of buttons (e.g., "1x", "2x", "4x").
