**Step 2: Notice the Shift**
- **Trigger**: The game reaches week 5.
- **Task Flow**: The player notices that the demand has suddenly jumped from 4 to 8 units.
- **System Feedback**: The change in demand could be highlighted with a small animation or a temporary color change to draw attention to it.
