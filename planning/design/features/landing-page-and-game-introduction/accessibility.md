# Accessibility: Landing Page & Game Introduction

## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility requirements for the landing page to ensure it is usable by people of all abilities.

## Requirements

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements, including the "Start Game" button and any links, must be focusable and operable via the keyboard.
- The tab order must be logical, following the visual flow of the page.
- A visible focus indicator must be present on all focusable elements.

### Screen Readers
- The page must have a logical heading structure (H1, H2, etc.).
- All images must have descriptive `alt` text.
- The "Start Game" button must have a clear and descriptive accessible name.

### Color Contrast
- All text must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements.
- The primary CTA button must have sufficient contrast in all states (default, hover, focus).

### Motion
- Scroll animations should be disabled for users with the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query enabled.

## Testing Criteria
- **Automated**: Run Axe and Lighthouse scans to identify and fix any automated accessibility issues.
- **Manual**:
  - Navigate the entire page using only the keyboard.
  - Test with a screen reader (NVDA or VoiceOver) to ensure a coherent experience.
  - Use a color contrast checker to verify all text and UI elements.
