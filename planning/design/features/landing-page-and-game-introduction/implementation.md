# Implementation Notes: Landing Page & Game Introduction

## Overview
This document provides guidance for developers on implementing the landing page, including component references, asset specifications, and interaction details.

## Component Library
- **Button**: Use the `PrimaryButton` variant for the main CTA.
- **Card**: Use the `InfoCard` component for the "How to Play" and "Features" sections.
- **Typography**: Adhere to the type scale defined in the `typography.md` token file.

## Spacing
- Use the defined spacing tokens for all margins and paddings. For example, the space between the hero section and the "How to Play" section should be `spacing.xl`.

## Animations
- **Scroll Animations**: Use a library like `Framer Motion` or `Intersection Observer API` to trigger animations on scroll.
- **Transitions**: Implement CSS transitions for hover and active states on interactive elements.

## Assets
- **Icons**: Use SVG icons for the "How to Play" cards for scalability and performance.
- **Images**: Optimize all images for the web to ensure fast loading times.

## Responsive Design
- Use Tailwind CSS's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to implement the mobile-first design.
- Pay close attention to the typography and spacing adjustments for smaller screens.

## Accessibility
- Ensure all interactive elements have the correct ARIA roles and attributes.
- Implement the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query in CSS to disable animations.
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```
