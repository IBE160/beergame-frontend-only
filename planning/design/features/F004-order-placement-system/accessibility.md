# Accessibility: Order Placement

- **Labels**: The input field will have a clear, programmatically associated `<label>`.
- **Error Messages**: Validation errors will be linked to the input using `aria-describedby` so they are announced by screen readers.
- **Modal**: The confirmation modal will trap focus, so a keyboard user cannot accidentally interact with the dashboard behind it.
