# Implementation Notes: Order Placement

- **State**: The order value will be managed by a local `useState` in the `OrderInput` component.
- **Validation**: Use a simple regular expression (`/^[0-9]+$/`) for input validation.
- **Modal**: Use a pre-built, accessible modal component from a library like Radix or Headless UI.
