# Accessibility: Game Dashboard

## 1. WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

This feature is critical and must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

## 2. Specific Requirements

- **Keyboard Navigation**: 
    - The tab order must be logical, allowing the user to easily navigate to the order input, the place order button, and any other interactive elements like chart controls.
    - The charts themselves should be keyboard-navigable, allowing a user to step through data points.

- **Screen Readers & Live Regions**: 
    - The dashboard will be a primary area for ARIA live regions. Key metrics that change each week (like Inventory, Cost, and new Orders) should be announced to screen reader users.
    - `aria-live="polite"` will be used for most updates to avoid interrupting the user.
    - Critical alerts, like a new backlog, might use `aria-live="assertive"`.
    - The charts need to be accessible. This can be achieved by providing a data table alternative or by using a library that supports accessible chart rendering.

- **Color Contrast**: 
    - All text and data visualizations must meet contrast requirements.
    - The semantic colors (red for backlog, etc.) will be checked to ensure they have sufficient contrast.

- **Motion**: 
    - All animations (number counting, transitions) will be disabled if `prefers-reduced-motion` is active. The data will simply appear in its new state.
