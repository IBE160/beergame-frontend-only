# Implementation Notes: Difficulty Settings

- **State**: The selected difficulty will be another piece of state in the game configuration screen.
- **Logic**: The difficulty setting will be passed to the game engine. The engine will then use this setting to adjust the parameters of the AI ordering logic.
    - **Easy**: AI is less reactive.
    - **Normal**: Standard AI behavior.
    - **Hard**: AI is more volatile and overreacts more.
