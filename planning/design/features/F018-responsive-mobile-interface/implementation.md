# Implementation Notes: Mobile

- **CSS Framework**: A mobile-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS is ideal for this. The design will be built for mobile first, and then media queries will be used to add the desktop layout.
- **Breakpoints**: The breakpoints defined in the design system will be used to control the layout changes.
- **Tabs**: A headless UI library can be used to create the accessible tab component.
