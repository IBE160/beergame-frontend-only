# Implementation Notes: Multi-Game Stats

- **Data Storage**: The summary data for each completed game will be stored in an array in `localStorage`.
    ```json
    {
      "multiGameStats": [
        { "gameId": "123", "score": 5400, "date": "2025-09-21" },
        { "gameId": "456", "score": 4800, "date": "2025-09-22" }
      ]
    }
    ```
- **Data Retrieval**: The statistics page will read this array from `localStorage` and use it to generate the charts and summary metrics.
