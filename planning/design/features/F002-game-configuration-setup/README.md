# Feature: Game Configuration Setup (F002)

## 1. User Experience Analysis

- **Primary User Goal**: To easily choose a role and set the game length before starting.
- **Success Criteria**: A user can select a role and duration and start the game in under 30 seconds.
- **Key Pain Points Addressed**: Prevents users from being thrown into a game without context or control over their experience.
- **User Personas**: All user types, from students to professionals, will use this screen.

## 2. Information Architecture

- **Content Hierarchy**:
    1.  **Screen Title**: "Game Setup" or "Configure Your Game".
    2.  **Role Selection**: A visually engaging selection of the four roles.
    3.  **Duration Selection**: A simple slider or input for the game length.
    4.  **Start Button**: A prominent button to begin the game.
- **Navigation Structure**: This is a modal or a dedicated page that appears after the landing page CTA. It leads directly to the game dashboard.
- **Mental Model Alignment**: Aligns with the common pattern of setting up a new game or document.
- **Progressive Disclosure Strategy**: Role descriptions are concise, with perhaps a "Learn More" link for detailed information if needed, to avoid cluttering the screen.
