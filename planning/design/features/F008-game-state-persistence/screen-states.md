# Screen States: Game Persistence

## Component: Landing Page CTA

### State: Saved Game Detected

**Visual Design**: The primary CTA button text is "Resume Game". A secondary, less prominent button appears below it with the text "Start New Game".

## Component: In-Game Save Indicator

### State: Visible

**Visual Design**: A small, unobtrusive toast notification or a subtle message in the corner of the screen appears for a few seconds after each week is completed, saying "Game Saved".

## Component: Abandon Game Modal

### State: Visible

**Visual Design**: A modal overlay that asks "Are you sure you want to abandon your current game? All progress will be lost." with "Yes, Abandon" and "No, Continue" buttons.
