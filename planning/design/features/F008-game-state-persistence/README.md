# Feature: Game State Persistence (F008)

## 1. User Experience Analysis

- **Primary User Goal**: To be able to close the browser and resume a game later without losing progress.
- **Success Criteria**: A user can successfully resume a game after closing and reopening the browser.
- **Key Pain Points Addressed**: Prevents the frustration of losing game progress due to accidental closing of the tab or browser.

## 2. Information Architecture

- This is a background feature with a few key touchpoints in the UI:
    - **Landing Page**: The "Play Now" button changes to "Resume Game".
    - **In-Game**: A small "Game Saved" indicator might appear periodically.
    - **Settings**: An option to "Abandon Game and Start New".
