# Implementation Notes: Game Persistence

- **Technology**: Browser `localStorage` is the mechanism for storing the game state.
- **Serialization**: The entire game state object will be serialized to a JSON string before being saved to `localStorage`.
    - `localStorage.setItem('beer-game-save', JSON.stringify(gameState));`
- **Deserialization**: On load, the application will check for this key. If it exists, it will parse the JSON back into a game state object.
- **Error Handling**: The loading process should be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors with corrupted `localStorage` data. If an error occurs, the saved data should be cleared.
