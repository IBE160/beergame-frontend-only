# Interactions: Game Completion

- **Score Animation**: The final score should animate in a satisfying way, perhaps with a count-up animation.
- **Chart Hover**: The charts on this screen are also interactive, allowing the user to review their game data.
- **CTAs**: The "Play Again" and "Try a Different Role" buttons have standard button interactions.
