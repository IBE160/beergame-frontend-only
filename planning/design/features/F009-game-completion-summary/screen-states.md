# Screen States: Game Completion

## Screen: Summary Screen

### State: Default

**Visual Design**: A visually engaging summary screen. The final score is the hero element. It uses charts and graphs to visualize the performance breakdown. The overall tone is positive and encouraging.

### State: Good Performance

**Visual Design**: If the player's score is below a certain threshold, the screen might have a more celebratory feel, with more positive colors and messaging.

### State: Poor Performance

**Visual Design**: If the player's score is high (which is bad in this game), the messaging is more focused on the learning aspect, with clear explanations of what might have happened (e.g., "Did you notice the bullwhip effect?").
