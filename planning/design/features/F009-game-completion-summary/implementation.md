# Implementation Notes: Game Completion

- **Data**: This screen will be passed the final `historicalData` array as a prop.
- **Calculations**: The final score and other metrics will be calculated from the historical data.
- **Charts**: The same chart components used on the dashboard can be reused here.
- **Routing**: This screen will be a separate page in the application (e.g., `/summary`).
