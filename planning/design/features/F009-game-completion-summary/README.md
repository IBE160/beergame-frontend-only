# Feature: Game Completion Summary (F009)

## 1. User Experience Analysis

- **Primary User Goal**: To understand how well they performed in the game and what they can learn from it.
- **Success Criteria**: A user can state their final score and identify one key takeaway from their game.
- **Key Pain Points Addressed**: Provides a clear sense of closure and reinforces the educational goals of the game.

## 2. Information Architecture

- **Content Hierarchy**:
    1.  **Headline**: A congratulatory message (e.g., "Game Over!").
    2.  **Key Score**: The player's total cost, presented as the primary score.
    3.  **Performance Breakdown**: A more detailed look at the costs (inventory vs. backlog).
    4.  **Key Insights**: A section explaining the bullwhip effect, especially if it was detected in the player's game.
    5.  **Call to Action**: Buttons to "Play Again" or "Try a Different Role".
