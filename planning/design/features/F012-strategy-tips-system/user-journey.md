# User Journey: Strategy Tips

### Core Experience Flow

**Step 1: A Trigger Occurs**
- **Trigger**: The player's inventory grows very large for several weeks in a row.
- **Task Flow**: A toast notification appears with a helpful tip.

**Step 2: Read the Tip**
- **Task Flow**: The user reads the tip, which might say: "High inventory is costly. Try to keep your stock lean."
- **System Feedback**: The toast is dismissible, or it disappears on its own after a few seconds.

**Step 3: Apply the Knowledge**
- **Task Flow**: The user applies the advice from the tip to their strategy in the following weeks.
