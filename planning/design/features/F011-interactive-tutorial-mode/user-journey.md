# User Journey: Interactive Tutorial

### Core Experience Flow

**Step 1: Start Tutorial**
- **Trigger**: A first-time user opts to start the tutorial from a prompt on the landing page or configuration screen.
- **Task Flow**: The game dashboard loads, but it is partially obscured by a welcome message for the tutorial.

**Step 2: Follow Instructions**
- **Task Flow**: The user follows a sequence of instructions. For example:
    1.  "This is your inventory. You have 12 units."
    2.  "A customer has ordered 4 units."
    3.  "Now, you need to place an order. Try ordering 4 units."
- **System Feedback**: The tutorial only proceeds when the user has completed the required action.

**Step 3: Complete Tutorial**
- **Task Flow**: After a few weeks of guided play, the tutorial ends.
- **Success State**: The user is now in the live game and can continue playing on their own.
