# Feature: Interactive Tutorial Mode (F011)

## 1. User Experience Analysis

- **Primary User Goal**: To learn how to play the game through a guided, step-by-step experience.
- **Success Criteria**: A user who completes the tutorial can confidently play the game on their own.
- **Key Pain Points Addressed**: Reduces the initial learning curve and prevents the user from feeling overwhelmed.

## 2. Information Architecture

- **Overlay**: The tutorial will be an overlay on top of the main game dashboard.
- **Tooltip-style Instructions**: A series of tooltips will point to different UI elements and explain what they do.
- **Progress Indicator**: A small indicator will show the user how far they are in the tutorial (e.g., "Step 1 of 5").
