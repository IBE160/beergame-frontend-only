# User Journey: Keyboard Shortcuts

### Core Experience Flow

**Step 1: Discover Shortcuts**
- **Trigger**: The user wants to know if there are keyboard shortcuts.
- **Task Flow**: The user presses the "?" key, which opens a help modal displaying a list of all available shortcuts.

**Step 2: Use a Shortcut**
- **Task Flow**: The user presses the "Enter" key to submit their weekly order instead of clicking the button.
- **System Feedback**: The action is performed just as if the button had been clicked.
