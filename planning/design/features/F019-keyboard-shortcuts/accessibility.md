# Accessibility: Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Discoverability**: The shortcuts must be easily discoverable.
- **Customization**: Ideally, users should be able to customize the shortcuts, although this is a non-essential feature.
- **Conflict**: The shortcuts should not conflict with standard browser or assistive technology shortcuts.
