# Implementation Notes: Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Library**: A library like [Hotkeys.js](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/hotkeys) can be used to easily manage keyboard shortcuts.
- **Event Listener**: A global event listener for keydown events will be added to the application.
- **Mapping**: A simple object will map key combinations to the functions that trigger the actions.
