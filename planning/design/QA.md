# Quality Assurance Process

## Overview
This document outlines the quality assurance (QA) process for our design system to ensure that it is robust, consistent, and bug-free.

## Process
- **Design Review**: All new components and patterns must be reviewed by at least one other designer.
- **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer.
- **Testing**:
  - **Unit Tests**: All components should have unit tests to verify their functionality.
  - **Visual Regression Tests**: We use visual regression testing to catch unintended visual changes.
  - **Accessibility Tests**: All components must pass automated and manual accessibility tests.
- **Documentation**: All components must be documented with usage guidelines and examples.
