# Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility standards and best practices to be followed throughout the design and development of the Beer Game application. Our goal is to create an inclusive experience that is usable by people of all abilities.

## Standards
The project aims to comply with the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.

## Key Guidelines

### 1. Perceivable
- **Color Contrast**: All text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background. Large text (18pt or 14pt bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
- **Color Usage**: Color should not be the only means of conveying information. Use icons, text, or other visual cues to supplement color.
- **Alternative Text**: All meaningful images must have descriptive alt text. Decorative images should have empty alt attributes.

### 2. Operable
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be focusable and operable using only a keyboard. The focus order must be logical and intuitive.
- **Focus Visible**: A clear and consistent focus indicator must be visible on all focusable elements.
- **Consistent Navigation**: Navigation patterns should be consistent across all pages.

### 3. Understandable
- **Clear Language**: Use clear and simple language. Avoid jargon and complex terms.
- **Readable Text**: Ensure text is readable by following the typography guidelines for size, weight, and line height.
- **Predictable UI**: Components and interactions should behave in a predictable and consistent manner.

### 4. Robust
- **Semantic HTML**: Use semantic HTML elements to properly structure content and convey meaning to assistive technologies.
- **ARIA Roles**: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes where necessary to enhance the accessibility of dynamic components.

## Testing
- **Automated Testing**: Use automated tools like Axe or Lighthouse to catch common accessibility issues.
- **Manual Testing**: Perform manual testing, including keyboard-only navigation and screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver).
