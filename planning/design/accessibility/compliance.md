# WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

This document tracks our compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the Level AA standard.

## Conformance Status

We are partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA. "Partially conformant" means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.

We are actively working to achieve full conformance.

## Compliance Checklist

This section will be filled out with a detailed checklist of all WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria and our status for each one.

*(This will be a living document that is updated as the project progresses.)*
