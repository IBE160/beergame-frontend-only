# Project Design Overview

## Introduction
This document serves as the central hub for all design-related documentation for the Beer Game Supply Chain Simulation project. It provides a structured overview of the design system, feature-specific design files, accessibility guidelines, and other critical design artifacts. The goal is to create a single source of truth for designers, developers, and stakeholders, ensuring consistency and clarity throughout the project lifecycle.

## Table of Contents
- [Design System](./design-system/README.md)
- [Features](./features/README.md)
- [Accessibility](./accessibility/README.md)
- [Assets](./assets/README.md)

## How to Navigate This Documentation
- **Design System**: Explore the foundational elements of our visual language, including color, typography, components, and design tokens.
- **Features**: Find detailed design specifications for each feature, including user journeys, screen states, and interaction patterns.
- **Accessibility**: Review our commitment to inclusive design, with detailed guidelines and compliance documentation.
- **Assets**: Access design tokens, reference images, and other essential assets for development.

## Design Philosophy
Our design philosophy is rooted in **bold simplicity** and **user-centricity**. We aim to create an intuitive and frictionless experience that prioritizes user needs over decorative elements. By leveraging strategic whitespace, a systematic color palette, and clear typography, we create a visually pleasing and highly functional interface.
