# Design Overview: Beer Game Simulation

## 1. Introduction

This design documentation outlines the visual and interaction design framework for the Beer Game Supply Chain Simulation. Our goal is to create an interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and highly intuitive, enabling users to learn complex supply chain concepts without friction.

The design is founded on principles of **bold simplicity** and **strategic clarity**, ensuring that educational goals are met through a clean, responsive, and accessible user experience.

## 2. Navigation

This document serves as a central hub for all design-related artifacts.

### Design System
- **[Style Guide](./design-system/style-guide.yaml)**: The complete specification for colors, typography, spacing, and components.
- **[Design Tokens](./design-system/tokens/README.md)**: Detailed documentation for the foundational elements of our design language.
- **[Component Library](./design-system/components/README.md)**: Specifications for all UI components.

### Feature Designs
- **[Feature Design Hub](./features/README.md)**: Overviews and links to detailed design documentation for each project feature.

### Accessibility
- **[Accessibility Strategy](./accessibility/README.md)**: Our comprehensive approach to ensuring the application is usable by everyone.

## 3. Design Philosophy

Our design philosophy is guided by three core principles:

1.  **Clarity First**: Every design choice must prioritize clear communication and understanding. The interface should teach, not distract.
2.  **Effortless Interaction**: User flows will be streamlined and intuitive, minimizing cognitive load and allowing users to focus on strategic decisions.
3.  **Scalable & Consistent**: The design system is built to be modular and reusable, ensuring a consistent experience across all parts of the application and future updates.
