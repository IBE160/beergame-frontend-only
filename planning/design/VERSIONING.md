# Versioning Process

## Overview
This document outlines the versioning process for our design system and documentation. We use semantic versioning (SemVer) to manage changes.

## Semantic Versioning
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version for adding functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Process
- All changes to the design system must be documented in a changelog.
- All files should have a `last-updated` and `version` field in their frontmatter.
- Significant changes should be communicated to the team.
