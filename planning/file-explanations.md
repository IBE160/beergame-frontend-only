# Next.js Application File Explanations

This document provides a breakdown of each file's role in the Next.js application, based on the project structure.

### Core Application Files (`src/app/`)

*   `src/app/layout.tsx`: This is the **root layout** for your entire application. It defines the main `<html>` and `<body>` tags and wraps around every page. It's the place to put elements that are shared across all pages, like a header, footer, or a consistent background color.

*   `src/app/page.tsx`: This file defines the **homepage** of your application, which is the content for the `/` route. The component exported from this file is rendered within the `layout.tsx`.

*   `src/app/globals.css`: This is for **global CSS styles** that apply to your entire application. It's where you'd put styles for the `body` tag, reset default browser styles, or define CSS variables.

*   `src/app/favicon.ico`: This is the **icon** that appears in the browser tab for your application.

### Components (`src/components/`)

This directory is for your reusable React components.

*   `src/components/ui/`: This sub-directory is for general-purpose, reusable UI elements that are not specific to any particular feature of your application.
    *   `Button.tsx`: A reusable button component.
    *   `Card.tsx`: A reusable card component for displaying content.
    *   `Input.tsx`: A reusable input field component.
    *   `Modal.tsx`: A reusable modal (pop-up) component.
    *   `Slider.tsx`: A reusable slider component.
    *   `Tabs.tsx`: A reusable tabs component for navigation.

### Public Assets (`public/`)

The `public` directory is for static assets that are publicly accessible from the root of your application.

*   `public/*.svg`: These are Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files, likely used for images and icons in your application.

### Configuration Files (Root Directory)

These files are in the root of your project and control how your Next.js application is built and runs.

*   `.gitignore`: This file tells Git which files and folders to ignore when you commit your code. This is used to exclude things like `node_modules` and `.next` from version control.

*   `next.config.ts`: This is the main **configuration file for Next.js**. You can use it to customize the build process, add environment variables, and configure other advanced features.

*   `package.json`: This file lists all the **dependencies** (libraries) your project uses and defines scripts for running, building, and testing your application (e.g., `npm run dev`).

*   `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated by `npm` to lock down the exact versions of your dependencies, ensuring that your project builds consistently across different machines.

*   `postcss.config.mjs`: This is the configuration file for **PostCSS**, a tool that transforms your CSS with plugins. It's often used with Tailwind CSS.

*   `tailwind.config.ts`: This is the configuration file for **Tailwind CSS**. It's where you define your color palette, fonts, and other design tokens to customize the utility classes that Tailwind provides.

*   `tsconfig.json`: This is the configuration file for **TypeScript**. It tells the TypeScript compiler how to check your code for errors and compile it into JavaScript.

*   `eslint.config.mjs`: This is the configuration file for **ESLint**, a tool that analyzes your code to find and fix problems, ensuring a consistent code style.
