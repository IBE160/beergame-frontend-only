# ðŸ“„ Project Brief: Beer Game Supply Chain Simulation

## 1. Project Overview
**Summary:**
A web-based implementation of the MIT Beer Game supply chain simulation that allows players to experience and learn about supply chain dynamics through an interactive single-player game where they manage inventory, orders, and costs in a beer distribution network.

**Background / Context:**
The Beer Game is a renowned educational tool developed at MIT in the 1960s to teach supply chain management concepts. This digital implementation will make the simulation accessible online, allowing players to understand critical supply chain phenomena like the bullwhip effect, inventory management, and the impact of information delays. The application will serve as an educational platform for students, professionals, and anyone interested in understanding supply chain dynamics without requiring physical game materials or multiple participants.

## 2. Objectives and Goals
**Objectives:**
- Create an engaging, educational simulation that demonstrates supply chain management principles
- Enable single-player gameplay with AI-controlled supply chain partners
- Visualize supply chain dynamics through real-time data and charts
- Teach players about the bullwhip effect and importance of strategic ordering decisions
- Provide immediate feedback on player performance through cost tracking and analytics

**Success Criteria / KPIs:**
- Players can complete a full game session (20-52 weeks) without technical issues
- Game accurately simulates supply chain delays and cost calculations
- Clear visualization of inventory levels, orders, and costs throughout gameplay
- Players achieve understanding of key concepts (bullwhip effect, inventory management)
- Intuitive user interface requiring minimal learning curve
- Performance metrics clearly displayed at game completion

## 3. Target Audience and Users
**Primary Users:**
- Business and engineering students learning supply chain management
- Supply chain professionals seeking training tools
- Educators teaching operations management
- Business professionals interested in understanding supply chain dynamics
- Anyone curious about how supply chains work

**User Needs / Pain Points:**
- Need for accessible supply chain education without physical materials
- Difficulty understanding abstract supply chain concepts without hands-on experience
- Lack of single-player options for practicing supply chain decision-making
- Need for immediate feedback on decisions and their downstream effects
- Desire to experiment with different strategies without real-world consequences
