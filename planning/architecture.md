# Beer Game Supply Chain Simulation: Technical Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical architecture for the Beer Game Supply Chain Simulation, a frontend-only web application.

- **Project Overview**: A single-player, browser-based simulation of the MIT Beer Game, designed as an educational tool.
- **Key Architectural Decisions**:
    - **Frontend-Only**: To simplify development and deployment, the application will be entirely client-side.
    - **Component-Based**: The UI will be built using a modular, reusable component architecture.
    - **Local Persistence**: Game state will be persisted in the browser's `localStorage`.
- **Technology Stack**:
    - **Framework**: Next.js (React)
    - **Language**: TypeScript
    - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
    - **State Management**: Zustand
- **System Components**:
    - **Game Engine**: Manages the core game logic.
    - **UI Components**: A library of reusable React components.
    - **State Manager**: Handles the application's state.
    - **Persistence Layer**: Manages saving and loading the game state to `localStorage`.

## For Backend Engineers

This is a frontend-only application, so there are no backend considerations.

## For Frontend Engineers

### Component Architecture
- The application will be built using a modular, component-based architecture.
- Components will be organized by feature (e.g., `landing-page`, `game-dashboard`).
- A `components` directory will contain a library of reusable, presentational components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`).

### State Management
- **Zustand** will be used for state management. It is a lightweight and simple state management library that is well-suited for this project.
- The main state store will contain the `GameState`, which includes the state of all four supply chain positions, the current week, and the historical data.

### API Integration
- No API integration is required.

### Routing
- **Next.js App Router** will be used for routing.
- The following routes will be defined:
    - `/`: The landing page.
    - `/setup`: The game configuration screen.
    - `/game`: The main game dashboard.

### Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Next.js will automatically handle code splitting to reduce the initial bundle size.
- **Image Optimization**: Images will be optimized for the web.
- **Memoization**: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` will be used to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## For QA Engineers

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Jest and React Testing Library will be used to write unit tests for all components and utility functions.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Playwright will be used to write end-to-end tests for the main user flows.
- **Visual Regression Tests**: A visual regression testing tool will be used to catch unintended visual changes.

### Testable Boundaries
- The game logic will be separated from the UI, making it easy to test in isolation.
- Components will be designed to be testable, with clear props and interfaces.

## For Security Analysts

### Security Model
- As a frontend-only application with no user accounts, the attack surface is minimal.
- **Input Validation**: All user input will be validated to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Security Headers**: Standard security headers will be configured.
