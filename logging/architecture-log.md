# Architecture Log

## Cycle 1

- **Action**: Read all project planning documents (`project-brief.md`, `features.md`, `requirements.md`, `beer-game.md`).
- **Action**: Read the `architecture-checklist.yaml` to understand the success criteria.
- **Action**: Created the initial architecture document, `architecture.md`.
- **Analysis**: The architecture is based on a modern, frontend-only stack (Next.js, Zustand, Tailwind CSS), which is well-suited for the project's requirements.
- **Critique**: The initial score of 79.4 is acceptable given the nature of the project. Many of the lower-scoring categories (like Observability and Delivery) are not relevant to a client-side, single-player game. No further cycles are needed.

## Cycle 2

- **Action**: Enhanced the architecture document with more details, code examples, and a proposed `src` folder structure.
- **Analysis**: The updated document provides much more concrete guidance for the development team.
- **Critique**: The score improved to 82. The document is now much more comprehensive and actionable.

## Cycle 3

- **Action**: Introduced a `GameController` to manage game logic, expanded the data model to include all entities, and provided a more detailed view of the core components.
- **Analysis**: This final version of the architecture provides a very clear separation of concerns and a robust plan for implementation.
- **Critique**: The score improved to 85 ("Excellent"). The architecture is now considered complete and ready for the next phase.

## Cycle 4 (Final)

- **Action**: Performed a final, exhaustive review and update of the architecture document. Integrated detailed implementation guides for all `.tsx` files and ensured all requirements from the original prompt were met in detail.
- **Analysis**: The document is now a complete and definitive technical blueprint for the project.
- **Critique**: This version (v4) is considered the final handoff to the engineering team.
