# Architecture Log

## Cycle 1

- **Action**: Read all project planning documents (`project-brief.md`, `features.md`, `requirements.md`, `beer-game.md`).
- **Action**: Read the `architecture-checklist.yaml` to understand the success criteria.
- **Action**: Created the initial architecture document, `architecture.md`.
- **Analysis**: The architecture is based on a modern, frontend-only stack (Next.js, Zustand, Tailwind CSS), which is well-suited for the project's requirements.
- **Critique**: The initial score of 79.4 is acceptable given the nature of the project. Many of the lower-scoring categories (like Observability and Delivery) are not relevant to a client-side, single-player game. No further cycles are needed.

## Cycle 2

- **Action**: Enhanced the architecture document with more details, code examples, and a proposed `src` folder structure.
- **Analysis**: The updated document provides much more concrete guidance for the development team.
- **Critique**: The score improved to 82. The document is now much more comprehensive and actionable.
