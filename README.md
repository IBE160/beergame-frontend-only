This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Landing Page Description

**Overall Impression:**
The landing page is designed to be clean, professional, and engaging, with a modern corporate aesthetic. It uses a well-defined color palette and generous spacing to create a clear visual hierarchy that guides the user through the information.

**Color Palette:**
*   **Background:** The primary background is a soft, light gray (`neutral-50`), creating a bright and airy feel. This is contrasted with sections that use a very light blue (`primary-light`) for emphasis, such as the main hero section.
*   **Primary Colors:** A strong, trustworthy blue (`primary` and `primary-dark`) is used for key branding elements, headings, and icons, establishing a professional tone.
*   **Accent Color:** A vibrant amber/gold (`accent-primary`), reminiscent of beer, is used for the main call-to-action buttons to draw the user's attention.
*   **Text:** Text is primarily a dark charcoal (`neutral-800` or `neutral-900`) for high readability, with softer grays (`neutral-600` or `neutral-700`) for secondary text.

**Layout and Structure:**
*   **Header:** A sticky header at the top of the page has a semi-transparent white background with a subtle blur effect, allowing content to be seen underneath as the user scrolls. It contains the logo on the left and a primary "Play Now" button on the right.
*   **Hero Section:** This is a full-screen section designed to make a strong first impression. It features a large, bold headline, a descriptive paragraph, and two prominent call-to-action buttons, all centered. A subtle grid pattern is visible in the background.
*   **Content Sections:** The page is divided into clear, alternating sections with either a white or light gray background. Each section uses a centered layout for its main heading and subheading, followed by multi-column grids (typically three columns on desktops) to present features and information in a structured, easy-to-digest format.
*   **Visual Flow:** The layout uses a combination of centered text for introductions and a clear grid for details, guiding the user's eye down the page. A horizontal line visually connects the "Supply Chain Roles," reinforcing the concept of a chain.

**Typography:**
*   The primary font is 'Inter,' a clean sans-serif chosen for its excellent on-screen readability.
*   A clear typographic hierarchy is established, with large, bold headings (`h1`, `h2`) for section titles and smaller, regular-weight text for body content. This makes the page easy to scan.

**Iconography and Imagery:**
*   Clean, modern line icons from `lucide-react` are used to visually represent concepts (e.g., a shopping cart for the retailer, a truck for the distributor). The icons are styled with the primary blue color and are often enclosed in light blue circular backgrounds for emphasis.
*   The design includes a placeholder for a chart visualization, suggesting a data-driven and analytical theme.
